This whole project was done in Cadence Virtuoso, and this has no code as such, I designed the whole system ground up all the way from NOT gates to complex Modules such as flip flops 

following various textbook concepts of VLSI such as of modularity and Regularity 

Acheving a 21% percent reduction in power my scrambler design of this crirtical 5g system
